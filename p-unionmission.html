                    <h1>Union Mission</h1>
                    <span class="descriptor">A Savannah, GA organization for the homeless community. Their programs address shelter, long and short-term housing, health care, behavioral counseling, substance abuse, job and life skills training and employment assistance.</span>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The organization didn't have a consistent logo or brand even though they have been in operation since 1936. They needed a brand identity and website that showed compassion and featured their full range of community services.</p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed a logo that embodied the physical and emotional shelter the organization provided to the local homeless community.</li>
                        <li>Organized a color pallet that allowed each service a unique color "code," creating a <span class="highlight">unified look</span> that offers a way to differentiate the type of assistance offered.</li>
                        <li>The website utilized the pleasant color pallet while offering an <span class="highlight">easy-to-navigate pages</span> to allow patrons and donors to quickly find the pages relevant to their needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <ul class="plain-list">
                        <li>Web Developer</li>
                        <li>Graphic Designer</li>
