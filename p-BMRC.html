                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The Black Metropolis Research Consortium (BMRC) didn't have a specific style or brand, but they wanted to create an inviting Strategic Plan. They needed a design that look engaging and dynamic with a layout that showcased their archival materials, member institutions, and wealth of events.</p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using tints of the colors from their logo, I created a warm and welcoming color palette</li>
                        <li>Blocks of shapes and images segmented the dense amount of information into <span class="highlight">easily readable</span> and digestible sections.</li>
                        <li>Placing the images into geometric shapes lent a <span class="highlight">uniform look to images</span> that were taken over a series of years at various BMRC events.</li>
                        <li>This uniformity allowed for archival images to be integrated with contemporary images while created a link between the organization, their events, and their collections.</li>
                        <li>The dynamic shapes imbued the message of action and <span class="highlight">forward momentum</span> that the organization was capturing with their strategic plan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The design and layout was so well-received by the stakeholders and their community that the organization <span class="highlight">adopted this look</span> for further printed material.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <ul class="plain-list">
                        <li>Art Director</li>
                        <li>Lead Designer</li>
                    </ul>
