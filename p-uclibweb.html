                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The University of Chicago's website had not been changed in twelve years, leading to stale and repetitive content that was not mobile friendly or ADA compliant. The CMS was being retired, so we needed to find a new platform that we could be supported in-house and allow for all librarians to edit and add to as needed.</p>
                    <p>The website was text-heavy with patrons only using small and specific parts of the siloed content. Additionally, each of the five library branches had their own look as well as duplicative information that sometimes contradicted itself.</p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>After a full assessment of possible platforms, our team went with an open source Django CMS called Wagtail. Multiple user experience tests found which types of layouts and information patrons preferred and enhanced their research experience. This data along with student and faculty interviews allowed us to assess all the needs for the campus' various uses of the site. A complete site audit of all 8,000 webpages was done and triaged in order of migration importance or marked to be deleted.</p>
                    <p>Creation of a pattern library assured a cohesive interface look that allowed for reusable building blocks and clean code. This allowed for each library branch to have their own homepage with content that appealed to their patrons while also maintaining a cohesive brand. Reusable blocks was also implemented in content, with data being reused on various pages to allow for consistent and accurate information that only needed to be edited in one spot.</p>
                    <p>Templates with embedded styling allows for subject specialists to add content to their website sections without breaking the branding style. This allows for content creation to be democratically distributed and for information to stay up-to-date.</p>
                    <p>The homepage was chunked into visually-appealing modules that quickly show the services and events of the Library. Highly-used services, such as booking a study room, were prominently placed and easy to access. Due to the size of the website, Bootstrap framework was utilized, but was customized with em-based media queries using Sass calculations. ADA compliance was baked into the templates, using WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessibility conformance, and continues to be updated as new guidelines are introduced.</p>
                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>This new layout expanded the use of the website from patrons only interacting with the search box to fully interfacing with all elements on the page. Reference service use increased both online and in person. Click-throughs to news stories increased.</p>
