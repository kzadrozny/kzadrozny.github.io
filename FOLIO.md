# First Meeting
- How do our checklist get to developers? How do they know what we are shooting for?
- Should we only focus on the front end devs?
- ADA patrons tend to use IE; check to see if there is a more recent report than 2015
- The most current web browser is not supported by JAWS
- Need main development updates, focused on accessibility
- Accessibility will be focused on in one of the next few sprints
- We will get one of the available modules from FOLIO in the next few months that we can run through a Accessibility tester, that will give us a base.
- Get an idea of who the user test base is and test on their own machines so we are on their environment
- Possibly use SiteImprove to get a detailed report
- Involve the UX people from FOLIO
- John is building a Pattern Library for the UI
- Email that comes out on Friday, which is a week in review - get on the mailing list (https://ole-lists.openlibraryfoundation.org/ole) Go to the root and pick the OLE ole lists from the pulldown menu to get it.
- Making sure that testing is more integrated in development so that by the time it gets to acceptance testing, there isn't an issue of tracking major bugs
- Group feels accessibility testing should just be integrated with the rest of the testing (to add a bullet to the test list)
- Automated user interface testing: https://github.com/folio-org/ui-testing
