                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Originally called Pool-A-Rama, the company needed a new name and brand now that it was also selling indoor recreational items beyond just pools. Needed a brand that could easily be implemented on individually-owned retail locations throughout Chicagoland.</p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>Incorporated all the elements they sold under the concept of &quot;escape&quot; to create the name The Great Escape.</p>
                    <p>Identity uses blue of pool water and green of lawns and billiards tables to establish the expansive items carried by the company.</p>
                    <p>Simple icons are used to define each section of the store to create a joyful environment without detracting from the products.</p>
                    <p>In-store signage is simple to install and accompanied by uncomplicated brand standard guide that all store locations could easily follow.</p>
                    <p>Radio spots, TV ads, and sales announced the changed and linked the well-established Pool-A-Rama into the new identity of The Great Escape.</p>
                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>Online and instore <span class="highlight">sales increased</span> after the unveiling of the new identity.</p>
